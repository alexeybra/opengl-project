OpenGL project
====
Glad to see you in my student project for computer graphics course at Lomonosov Moscow State University.\
This course is point based, meaning student has to implement certain graphical effects using shaders written in GLSL language.\
These effects stuck up and if you get enough points, you pass the course.\

This project written in VS 2019 using GLFW, GLEW, GLM libraries. All code is basically in main.cpp file.\
I am sure for a lot of people such disorganization of the program with all the code written in one file is unacceptable.\
But it is faster this way if i am the only person who is every going to see this project.

The work contains effects like:\
Phong light model,\
normal mapping,\
billboard implementation,\
framebuffer grayscale post-effect,\
recursive mirrors,\
shadows (out of directional light source based on shadow map).

To start the project just simply download it and open Graphics.sln file in your VS 2019.\
All needed libraries are packed in external directory.

Controls:\
W - A - S - D - camera movements\
space - lifting the camera\
mouse - camera rotations\
ESC - close the program\
R - enable/disable mirrors on the scene

If you have any questions or suggestions please write to my personal email lixa4ik1@gmail.com.
